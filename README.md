# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based breast cancer prediction system that uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset . The primary goal is to predict whether a given breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign, which can aid in early diagnosis and medical decision-making . It involved exploring, preprocessing, and modeling data. Multiple algorithms were compared based on key metrics like accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. The aim was to identify the best-performing model for accurate breast cancer prediction .

## Project Structure:

- **Introduction and Import Libraries: Essential Python libraries are imported for data analysis and machine learning .
- **Download dataset directly from Kaggle:** Download Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set directly from Kaggle [2].
- **Data Reading and Exploratory Data Analysis:** The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its characteristics [4].
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data is preprocessed, including splitting it into training and testing sets, and scaling [4]. Perform LabelEncoding - Encode The 'diagnosis' Column Or Categorical Data Values [1].
- **Model Development:** Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied and trained on the dataset [4]. Split the data into Independent and Dependent sets to perform Feature Scaling [1]. Scaling The Dataset - Feature Scaling [1].
- **Building Logistic Regression Classifier:** Building Logistic Regression Classifier using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign [1][2].
- **Model Comparison:** The models' performances are compared using evaluation metrics and visualization [4]. Evaluate the performance of the model [1][2]. Model Accuracy On Confusion Matrix [1].
- **Predictive Analysis:** Finally, the models are used to predict breast cancer occurrences [4].

**About the Dataset:**

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available and commonly used in machine learning for cancer diagnosis tasks [4]. The dataset comprises various numerical features that assist in the classification of breast masses as either benign or malignant [4].
